## LeetCodeSync - Sync Your LeetCode Code to Google Drive

**LeetCodeSync** is a Chrome extension that solves a common problem faced by LeetCode enthusiasts. With LeetCodeSync, you can seamlessly sync your LeetCode code to your Google Drive, ensuring that your solutions are always accessible and shareable across multiple browsers and devices.

This is purely a proof of concept right now as I did not find enough interest to launch it to the chrome web store.

### Getting Started

1. Install the LeetCodeSync extension.
2. Open any leetcode page and make sure you are signed in.
3. Click on "Save" in the extension window and sign in to your Google account when prompted. After a few seconds you will recieve a success message. Check your google drive and you will find a newly created json file with the name "leetcode_sync". Do not touch it as that is where your solutions are stored.
5. Click the Restore button if you want to restore your solutions. To verify go to any problem that you have a solution for and delete all the code. Then click on restore and reload the page. Your code is back.

That's it! Your LeetCode solutions are now safely stored in your Google Drive, ready for you to access and share from anywhere.
